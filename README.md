### Important Deadlines:

Harrison (Software Architect):

- 7th June: Core Code finished by midnight 

- 11th June: Completion finished 

- 15th June: Challenge Complete 

Sub-deadlines are the touch ups, things that Amy & Conrad couldn’t fix, those deadlines are recommended. Given 2-3 days spare before the deadline to double check everything or in case we fall behind schedule. (See Updated Project Schedule).


(Notes: Please write clear annotations on your code for Amy & Conrad to easily understand, finishing code for them to test and debug is more important than the touch ups as we have a few days in the end should we need to use it) 


Amy & Conrad (Software writing, testing and documentation):

- 6th June: Testing regime is finished (I’ll help review) 

- 10th June: Core all tested and debugged as much as possible before returning to software architect Harry. 

- 14th June: Completion all tested and debugged as much as possible before returning to software architect Harry. 

- 17th June: Challenge all tested and debugged as much as possible before returning to software architect Harry. 

The Blue above are guidelines for you guys to start and work. (again referencing picture in Updated Project Schedule).


(Notes: Please make sure the testing is thorough and try to debug as much as possible to keep load off Harry as he has a very big load, if there are any problems or non clear requirements for testing speak to me and I’ll contact Arthur for you.) 


My Note: I tried to take into consideration the ecs calendar such as cybr due and tried to spread the deadlines apart to allow time however our schedule is very tight especially for 1 software architect to do most of the code, the earlier we get things done the more room we have for mistakes or last minute touch ups. Sorry for the tight schedule please bear with me and help each other out!!! Even though we are mostly at home team work will be a key factor to our efficiency and final project. If there is anything I missed do not hesitate to contact me.
